matrix calculator which enables mutiple matrix operation

Matrix calculator is widely and frequently used throughout all kinds of engineering fields especially in electrical and electronic engineering. Matrix are vastly applied in electrical circuit analysis as when writing differential equation describing resistive-inductive-capacitive circuit, the solution inevitably involve solving linear equation set which may contain 5 to 6 unknowns when the circuit contains multiple non-resistive components. Also with purely resistive circuit, according to KCL and KVL, complex linear equation set can be written to describe circuit properties when the topology become quite complex. With a well-designed matrix calculator, all the linear equation set would be easily solved. In communication field, when data are sent by sender and received by receiver, receiver would apply a strategy called hamming code where the received bits set are multiplied by a hamming code matrix and by comparing the resultant product matrix with standard matrix table, any transmission error can be found, located and corrected. Engineers can use matrix multiplication function in matrix calculator to compute the hamming code when analyzing communication system failure. 
This matrix calculator is equipped with both fundamental and advanced matrix-based calculation and can be applied wherever matrices are involved. As matrix are literally everywhere among EE engineering field, this matrix calculator is indeed a powerful helper to you engineering career.
